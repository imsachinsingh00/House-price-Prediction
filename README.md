# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using regression models based on features like location, size, and amenities.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Housing price prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
- `README.md`: Documentation file.

## 🏘️ Description

The project uses a real estate dataset to:
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Encode categorical features
- Train regression models
- Evaluate performance using R² and MAE

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or place the dataset in the working directory (if required).
2. Open `Housing price prediction.ipynb`.
3. Run each cell to process data, train the model, and visualize results.

## 🧠 Model Used

- Linear Regression
- Evaluation via train/test split and performance metrics

## 📈 Output

The model can predict the approximate price of a house given input features.
